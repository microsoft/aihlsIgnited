## **🤖 Recap Session 01 – Turning Unstructured Clinical Data into Value**

> We introduced the accelerator [MedIndexer](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/aihlsignited-medindexer) - which is an **indexing framework** designed for the **automated creation of structured knowledge bases** from unstructured clinical sources. It enables the transformation of **images (X-rays), clinical text, and other unstructured data** into a **schema-driven, searchable format**, allowing your applications to leverage **state-of-the-art retrieval methodologies**, including **vector search and re-ranking**, powered by **Azure AI Search**. By applying a **well-defined schema** and vectorizing the data into **high-dimensional representations**, MedIndexer empowers AI applications to retrieve **more precise and context-aware information**.

### **🔍 Turning Your Unstructured Data into Value**

> "About 80% of medical data remains unstructured and untapped after it is created (e.g., text, image, signal, etc.)"  
> — *Healthcare Informatics Research, Chungnam National University*

In the era of AI, the rise of AI copilots and assistants has led to a shift in how we access knowledge. But retrieving clinical data that lives in disparate formats is no trivial task. Building retrieval systems takes effort—and **how you structure your knowledge store matters**. It’s a cyclic, iterative, and constantly evolving process. That’s why we believe in leveraging **enterprise-ready retrieval platforms** like **Azure AI Search**—designed to power intelligent search experiences across structured and unstructured data. It serves as the foundation for building advanced retrieval systems in healthcare.

However, implementing **Azure AI Search** alone is not enough. Mastering its capabilities and applying well-defined patterns can significantly enhance your ability to address repetitive tasks and complex retrieval scenarios. This project aims to **accelerate your ability to transform raw clinical data into high-fidelity, high-value knowledge structures** that can power your next-generation healthcare applications.

#### 🏥 [Use Cases](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/aihlsignited-medindexer/tree/main/usecases)

### **📝 Creating Coded Policy Knowledge Stores**  

In many healthcare systems, policy documents such as pre-authorization guidelines are still trapped in static, scanned PDFs. These documents are critical—they contain ICD codes, drug name coverage, and payer-specific logic—but are rarely structured or accessible in real-time. To solve this, we built a pipeline that transforms these documents into intelligent, searchable knowledge stores.

<img src="images\Turning Policies into Knowledge Store.png" style="display: block; margin: 20px auto; border-radius: 15px; max-width: 80%; height: auto;" alt="Turning Policies into Knowledge Store" />

*This diagram shows how pre-auth policy PDFs are ingested via blob storage, passed through an OCR and embedding skillset, and then indexed into Azure AI Search. The result: fast access to coded policy data for AI apps.*

   - [🧾 Notebook - Creating Coded Policies Knowledge Stores](usecases/usecase-01-creating-coded-policies-knowledge-stores.ipynb)  
   Transform payer policies into **machine-readable formats**. This use case includes:  
     - Preprocessing and cleaning PDF documents  
     - Building custom OCR skills  
     - Leveraging out-of-the-box Indexer capabilities and embedding skills  
     - Enabling real-time AI-assisted querying for ICDs, payer names, drug names, and policy logic  

   **Why it matters**:  
   Streamlines prior authorization and coding workflows for providers and payors, reducing manual effort and increasing transparency.

### **🩻 Creating X-ray Knowledge Stores** 

In radiology workflows, X-ray reports and image metadata contain valuable clinical insights—but these are often underutilized. Traditionally, they’re stored as static entries in PACS systems or loosely connected databases. The goal of this use case is to turn those X-ray reports into a searchable, intelligent asset that clinicians can explore and interact with in meaningful ways.

<img src="images\Turning Xrays into Knowledge.png" style="display: block; margin: 20px auto; border-radius: 15px; max-width: 80%; height: auto;" alt="Turning X-rays into Actionable Knowledge" />

*This diagram illustrates a full retrieval pipeline where radiology reports are uploaded, enriched through foundational models, embedded, and indexed. The output powers an AI-driven web app for similarity search and decision support.*

   - [🧾 Notebook - Creating X-rays Knowledge Stores](usecases/usecase-02-creating-x-rays-knowledge-stores.ipynb)  
   Turn imaging reports and metadata into a searchable knowledge base. This includes:  
     - Leveraging push APIs with custom event-driven indexing pipeline triggered on new X-ray uploads  
     - Generating embeddings using Microsoft Healthcare foundation models  
     - Providing an AI-powered front-end for **X-ray similarity search**  

   **Why it matters**:  
   Supports clinical decision-making by retrieving similar past cases, aiding diagnosis and treatment planning with contextual relevance.
